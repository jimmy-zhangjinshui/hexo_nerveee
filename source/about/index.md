Jinshui Zhang, PhD student at Duke University. Working on power electronics, brain-machine interface, machine learning. 

In this page, I may share some thoughts about PhD itself. 

# Try to not kill yourself in your first year

I did only one thing last year --- getting comfortable. 

Guess what? I never did! Admit it, this world sucks, and it's going to suck more. 

# Schedule your time? Never!
I have wasted too much time on making schedules. And I never really obeyed them. Don't schedule tasks to your time, instead, to your location. 

We could and should and would have different modes during PhD and so on. Schedule a specific place for the specific mode. 

## Class @ classroom. 
Well, sure but not so obvious as you thought. Going to a class means you focus on the lecture for the next 90 minutes. If you can't or don't want this class, dont go. (Maybe don't pick it at first)

## System-Building @ Lab. 
The system could be hardware or software, and it would be the most object in your PhD. Building it is painful and exhausting. Also it takes lots of time. But you have to do it well. That's the only implementation of your ideas. Why in the lab? Well, because you can't take a hot iron and a bunch of PCBs to the library. 

## Thinking @ Library or cafe. 
PhD is intelligence intensive instead of labor. Your brain is more important than your hand, actually your brain domains your hands. When stuck, lab may keep you depressed, especially when you don't have a window or sunlight in your office. Then go out with your laptop. The crowd would crowd ideas into your mind. 

## Writing or preparing presentation @ Library
Read and sketch enough before you write. That gives you a clear mind. When you are ready to write, write and don't stop. (See more details in *On Writing Well*). 

## Homework @ Library


> A description for timeline. Getup without alarm. Read papers or news till 8:30. Eat breakfast and make a lunch. Arrive the LAB at 9:30. Build system or take a class if there is any. Eat lunch with friends at 1pm. Go back to work at 2 pm. Same work as morning. Go back to home and grab a dinner from 5pm to 6pm. Drive to library or play basketball. Go home at will. Boxing exercise and take a shower. Read and sleep.
