# Solar Panel + EV (+ Powerwall): A Tempting Vision of Future Energy
Introduce the energy chain of EV, solar panel (roof), and powerwall to provide bidirectional energy flow. 

# Redemption of Rich People
However, only rich people can afford this solution. 

# Realistic Solution
We need to make owning a car extremely expensive in urban area with exceptions to special needs. 
The high taxes of cars should be fed to build solar panels and public transportation. 
The rural areas, especially those who can't afford solar panels and EVs, are likely to continue using grid to get electricity. 
That only account for about 3% of the total population. 

# Electrifying Public Transportation: Ultimate Goal
In urban areas, where public transportation would be well developed, every vehicle should be electric, charged by solar panels. Meanwhile, they also acts as the energy storage units. When they run their routes, they will be driven and charged during sunny time, and supplying the whole city during dark time. 

However, the weather is still affecting the power too much. Good energy storage unit, i.e. safe and efficient, should be carried by cities. 

The end.
