> The object here is mainly for 1200 V SiC MOSFET. To be more specific, Infineon [FF11MR12W1M1_B11](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/mosfet/silicon-carbide/modules/ff11mr12w1m1_b11/). 

# Information collection

1. The SiC MOSFETs failed after short-circuit operations of 80 us and 50 us at 10V and lSV gate bias respectivel.[1]
