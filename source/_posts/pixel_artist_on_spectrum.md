# Why
This idea traces back to a cross-displin biomedical engineering project that I was working on from 2022 to 2024. The core of this project is magnetogenetics. In principle, **magnetogenetics** is to synthesize nanoparticles that can be selectively heated by magnetic field of different frequencies. 
Say, nanoparticle A can only be heated by 50 kHz wave but cannot by any other. 
While particle B can only be heated by 500 kHz but not any other. 

More explanation can be found in these papers:
1. [Subsecond multichannel magnetic control of select neural circuits in freely moving flies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01281-7)
2. [A wireless millimetric magnetoelectric implant for the endovascular stimulation of peripheral nerves](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00873-7)

My role here is to build a prototype that can generate these magnetic waves at the same time. The intensity shall be beyond 80 mT, which is quite a lot. 

You professionals may think that okay, this job can be easily done with some simple resonant circuit.
