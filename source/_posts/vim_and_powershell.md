# I LOVE VIM

## Coding, especially with Python

## Terminal Management
There is a dark area in computers, its name is Windows OS. 
Most of really cool stuff, such as Tmux, is not actually compatible with Windows. 

All the boring tools, such as LabVIEW, is undoubtly and exclusively supported by Windows. 

The latter situation makes using Windows inevitable for guys like me, the former situation makes daily work very depressing. 

Fortunately, the PowerShell on windows is kinda cool and is constantly being developed. However, there is no terminal management tool. 
Yes, you can use the Terminal application. But that thing is super slow (you can feel it even when you type!) and completely suspicious. 

Plus, people might want to switch to linux from time to time. Changing the shortcuts of managing terminal windows is a hell of fun. 

Therefore, the only decent solution to me now is actually VIM.
